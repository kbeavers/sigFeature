# sigFeature
sigFeature: sigFeature is an R package which is able to find out the significant features using support vector machine recursive feature elimination method (SVM-RFE)  (Guyon, I., et al. 2002) and t-statistic. Feature selection is an important  part dealing with machine learning technology. SVM-RFE is recognized as one  of the most effective filtering methods, which is based on a greedy algorithm that only finds the best possible combination for classification without  considering the differentially significant features between the classes.  To overcome this limitation of SVM-RFE, the proposed approach is tuned to  find differentially significant features along with notable classification accuracy. This package is able to enumerate the feature selection of any  two-dimensional (for binary classification) data such as a micro array etc.  This vignette explains the use of the package in a publicly available  micro array data set.
